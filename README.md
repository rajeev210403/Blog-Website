## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-link>
   cd simple-quiz-app
2. Install Dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
3. Run Application:
   ```bash
   npm run dev

## Assumptions
1. The user has an active internet connection to fetch the questions from the API.
2. Each question has a single correct answer.
3. The user‚Äôs email is required before starting the quiz.

## Challenges and Learnings

1. **Timer Syncronization**: Initially, keeping the timer synchronized with the user's quiz session was challenging. To address this, I ensured the timer logic is isolated and triggered every second while the quiz is active.
2. **Quiz Questions**:Managing the state for user answers, question navigation, and timer updates required careful consideration. I used React‚Äôs useState and useEffect hooks to handle all the state updates and side effects.
3. **Timer**:Ensuring smooth animations and responsiveness, I used Tailwind.
4. **Navigation**:
   - Users can navigate to specific questions via a navigation panel.
   - Question statuses are visually indicated for ease of use.
5. **End of Quiz Report**:
   - Displays each question, the user's answer, the correct answer, and incorrect options for comparison.
   - Includes detailed stats such as accuracy, correct answers, attempt rate, and questions attempted.
  
## Technologies Used:

- React Vite
- TypeScript
- Axios
- TailWind CSS

## How to Use:

- Enter your email address to start the quiz.
- Answer the questions or skip and revisit them using the navigation panel.
- Keep track of the timer at the top of the page.
- Submit the quiz or let it auto-submit when the timer ends.
- View the detailed quiz report and analyze your performance.
